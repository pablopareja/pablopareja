### 👋 Hi, I'm Pablo Pareja

I'm a **product-minded** **fullstack engineer** (**frontend focused**) who's passionate about building tools that matter — especially in the sustainability and social impact space. I love crafting elegant, user-centered experiences and collaborating across disciplines to turn ideas into meaningful products.
